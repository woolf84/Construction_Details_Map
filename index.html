		<h1>Whatâ€™s the Deal with Construction Details?</h1>
		<h2>A Perk for Cops Could Be Jobs for Your Family</h2>
		<p>Click on any place to learn how much cops earned from construction details in that area in 2019. Or explore individual details in depth by changing the data in the upper right.</p>
		<h3>What are construction details? </h3>
		<p>Weâ€™ve all seen cops in yellow vests at construction sites, telephone and electric work, and other street work. These cops arenâ€™t on duty. They are getting paid by private companies through the city to direct traffic. <a href="https://www.mass.gov/road-flaggers-and-police-detail">A state law passed in 2008</a> says that these flagger jobs, like they are in every other state, are open to civilian flaggers.</p>
		<h3>Working details is a perk that allows cops to make some extra money.</h3>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
			<li>In 2019, 1,357 BPD employees worked construction details working a total of more than 400,000 hours.</li>
			<li>The average wage for cops from construction details was $19,188.67. The median wage earned was even lower at $11,615.</li>
			<li>For cops working details, the average total income (combining regular, overtime, and detail wages) was $172,500. Without construction details, that average would still be $153,000.</li>
			<li>Some cops, however, work what amounts to a second job earning up more than $100,000 on top of their regular salaries and overtime. </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>By moving details out of the Police Department, the city could create a new department with over 200 new, middle-class jobs for people most harmed by policing.</h3>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
			<li>At $26,000,000, the money from construction details is almost as large as the entire budgets of the Parks Department ($27,000,000) and the Boston Center for Youth and Families ($28,000,000).</li>
			<li>These wages could provide up to 280 full time union jobs paying the median wage of $68,000 plus benefits.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>These jobs would create a significant investment in our communities.</h3>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
			<li>20% of details occur in Dorchester and Roxbury.</li>
			<li>Hiring for details must prioritize people who have been most impacted by policing, people with CORIs, and formerly incarcerated people.</li>
			<li>Details staffed by residents who take pride in their own neighborhood and know their neighborhoods will enhance public safety.</li>
		</ul>
